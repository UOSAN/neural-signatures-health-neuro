## Steps to convert DICOMS to BIDS

1. Create the `subject_list.txt` where each row has the input: `directoryName,subjectID,waveNumber`
    - An easy way to do this is to `cd` into your DICOM directory and use the command `ls >> subject_list.txt` , which will create a text file of that name and populate it with all the directories/files in your working directory. You can then move that subject_list.txt file to the directory from which you will be running your code and add the subject ID and time-point columns.
    - The subject_list should be formatted such that each row consists of: the subject directory names (that contains the dicoms), desired subject ID, and data collection wave number. Each field is comma separated, all without spaces, e.g.:

    `sub01_20150909,REV001,wave1`

    `sub01_20150909,REV001,wave2`

    `sub02_20150909,REV001,wave1`

2. Edit the `study_config.json` file such that it works for your study.  
    - See the [dcm2Bids](https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids) repository for documentation and instructions. ‚Üê for real, you'll need to read the instructions.  
3. Change the variables and/or paths in `config_``dcm2bids_batch.py` script for your study
    - Select whether the jobs are to be run serially on a local machine or in parallel on a HPC. (Select local)
4. `cd` to the directory that has your code in it. 
5. Run the batch script.  

  `python3 dcm2bids_batch.py`

8. Check the niftis, output logs, and error logs.
